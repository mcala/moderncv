# Andrew McAllister's Use of: 
## moderncv: a modern curriculum vitae class

I've gone ahead and made some relatively minor changes to the source  for
**Moderncv**, which are documented in the tracking provided by git. If you are
looking for the *original* moderncv package, by *Xavier Danaux*, please go to: https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv

> **Moderncv** provides a documentclass for typesetting
curricula vitae in various styles. Moderncv aims to be both straightforward to
use and customizable, providing five ready-made styles (classic, casual,
banking, oldstyle and fancy) and allowing one to define his own by modifying
colors, fonts, icons, etc.
