#Andrew McAllister's Use of:#
#moderncv: a modern curriculum vitae class#

**Moderncv** by *Xavier Danaux*, provides a documentclass for typesetting
curricula vitae in various styles. Moderncv aims to be both straightforward to
use and customizable, providing five ready-made styles (classic, casual,
banking, oldstyle and fancy) and allowing one to define his own by modifying
colors, fonts, icons, etc.

I've gone ahead and made some relatively minor changes to the source  for
**Moderncv**, which are documented in the tracking provided by git. If you are
looking for the *original* moderncv package, please go to: https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv
